Muse Ant Design Dashboard is a _free_ Admin Template based on two popular front-end technologies: _Ant Design & React_. It was built to simplify the developer's work and is comes with a fresh design inspired by Ant Design. All its components are built to fit perfectly with each other, while aligning to the Ant Design concepts.

Save weeks of time and build your perfect dashboard with this powerful template! It features 120 fully coded components and 7 example pages if you want to get inspiration or just show something directly to your clients. This beautiful admin also comes with 5 color filter choices for both the sidebar and the cards (blue, green, red, yellow and black), an option to have a transparent or fill sidebar and an option to have a fixed navbar.
